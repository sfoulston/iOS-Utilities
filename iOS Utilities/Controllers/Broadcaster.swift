/// A broadcaster is created as a public property of a class that needs to send
/// broadcasts about certain events. Each broadcaster is responsible for
/// broadcasting a specific payload, specified when the broadcaster is
/// initialised:
///
///	`public var newDataBroadcaster = Broadcaster<NSData>()
///	public var tupleBroadcaster = Broadcaster<(name: String, index: Int)>()`
///
/// Broadcasts are sent by calling `broadcast()`, and any other object can
/// subscribe to receive broadcasts by calling `subscribe()` on the relevant
/// broadcaster.
///
/// This type is safe to use from multiple threads. Note that no guarantee is
/// made about which thread broadcasts are sent from.

	/// a closure as a callback.
	///
	/// Only objects (not structs/enums) can subscribe using this method. A weak
	/// reference is kept to the subscriber so it can safely be deallocated
	/// without explicitly unsubscribing from the broadcast.
	///
	///	`notifyingObject.tupleBroadcaster.subscribe(self) { name, index in

	/// **Note:** In order for subscriptions to be automatically removed when
	/// the subscriber is deallocated, the `callback` closure must **not**
	/// capture a strong reference to the subscriber, as it will prevent its
	/// deallocation. Avoid this by using a capture list in the closure
	/// declaration as necessary:
	///
	/// `notifyingObject.newDataBroadcaster.subscribe(self) { [weak self] newData -> Void in
	///		self?.processData(newData)
	///		println("Data processed")

	///		- subscriber:
	///			The object subscribing to receive broadcasts.
	/// 	- callback:
	///			A callback closure to be called for each broadcast. The
	///			closure's parameters must match those of the receiver.
	/// - Returns:
	///		A Subscription object, used to explicitly unsubscribe from the
	///		receiver.
